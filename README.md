# GoLang Cheat Sheet 

I learn faster if I take the time to write things down, and I am getting old and find that if I create a reference for my self I am just being kind to the future me.  

I also believe if I find this information useful I think others will too.

This is my GoLang Reference.  Things I find usefull, Things I need to remember and resources I use.

## Enviroment 

Start by reading the (Getting Started go doc)[https://golang.org/doc/install#download]


## Learning

### TODO
I put the this section at the top so I never forget it.

#### What I need to read about but did not have time

- [Golang channels](http://guzalexander.com/2013/12/06/golang-channels-tutorial.html)
- [Goroutines, Closures, and You](https://blog.opsee.com/goroutines-closures-and-you-60aadcf285ba#.sgh39up7g)
- [Stopping Goroutines](https://medium.com/@matryer/stopping-goroutines-golang-1bf28799c1cb#.a2nvlmg0u)
- [Don't Get Bitten by Pointer vs Non-Pointer Method Receivers in Golang](https://nathanleclaire.com/blog/2014/08/09/dont-get-bitten-by-pointer-vs-non-pointer-method-receivers-in-golang/)
- [Maximizing the Use of Interfaces in Go](http://mwholt.blogspot.fr/2014/08/maximizing-use-of-interfaces-in-go.html)
- Finish reading [Effective go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)


### Reading (RTFM!)

This is my reading list. 

- You should always start with the free book [An Introduction To Go](http://www.golang-book.com/books/intro).  It seems silly but you never know what you dont know and I found a few gems in that book I might have missed later on.  Spending an 2 hours and a berr on working through [Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1)

- Here is my [amazon reading list](https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/HGQRISNNSBRH/ref=cm_wl_list_o_5?):  I will review each book below as I read them.



### Blogs

- [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) 
- This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndmB0bj7eyw) is really good in showing how you can do testing.
- I like Go by example it is a really nice resource. It pointed me to this [how to use interfaces in go](http://jordanorelli.com/post/32665860244/how-to-use-interfaces-in-go).

### Interfaces

The go interface can be extreamly cool and confusing at the same time!  


Read these:

- [Go by example, Interfaces](https://gobyexample.com/interfaces)
- [How to use interfaces in go](http://jordanorelli.com/post/32665860244/how-to-use-interfaces-in-go)
- [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndmB0bj7eyw) on testing and how to use Interfaces to make that eaiser. 
- [A list of interfaces in the std lib](http://sweetohm.net/article/go-interfaces.en.html) Why make a new interface?  Just use one that exists.

### JSON

JSON in go is fun and exciting!  Just use structs whereever you can and only marshal json to a unknown struct if you really have to!

Read these blogs:

- [JSON and Go](https://blog.golang.org/json-and-go) Really good read.
- [JSON by example](https://gobyexample.com/json) Becaue I love this site!
- [JSON package docs](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/) The examples really helped me.
- [Encode/Decode arbitrary JSON](http://michaelheap.com/golang-encodedecode-arbitrary-json/)

This tool ([json-to-go](https://mholt.github.io/json-to-go/)) is awesome for converting JSON to a struct. I love code generators!

When you have a complex json object that has a struct in a struct. brake them out and include one in the other.  This will allow more flexibility.   Here is an [example](https://play.golang.org/p/hdwgvKpeQw) on how you can do that.   I took the raw JSON and fed it through [json-to-go](https://mholt.github.io/json-to-go/) then broke the structs out and even added a method to the top struct. 


### Time

The [Time](https://golang.org/pkg/time/) package in go is quite nice.  Here are some resources around it:

- [Time formatting and parsing](https://gobyexample.com/time-formatting-parsing)

Play with it [here](https://play.golang.org/p/DCPFKZ7hER)



## SDLC

Coding in the Enterprise has some verry defined patterns.  When ever I learn a new language I am looking for how it fits in to these patterns. 

### IDE

- On my mac I like a rich editor that shows folders and files.  So I use [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) with the [GoSublime](https://github.com/DisposaBoy/GoSublime) plugin.  
- VIM with [vim-go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go)  I want to get [neocomplete](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplete.vim) working but have not yet. 


### Style
- Read about [naming](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#names) in effective go.
- [See the GoLang CodeReviewComments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)
- Formating is automatic with [go fmt](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#formatting)
- [Local scoped (private) Variables](http://www.golang-book.com/books/intro/4#section1) should be mixedCase or bumpyCaps.  This is for Variables or Constants in the private scope.
- [Comments](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#Commentary) have a style too.

### Testing

Testing is not an option.  You should do it!  Doing it correctly is the key.  This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndmB0bj7eyw) which I have cited may times before is really good place to start.  Here are some more resources.

#### Examples

As part of the testing framework you can also include examples and benchmarks.  At first I found this odd.  But as I started thinking about it, I have come to like the idea.  Write test files, add some benchmarks, and some examples to document your API.  Now your tests, benchmarking and documentation is all in the source, versioned, released, etc.  Thats nice.

- [GoDoc Examples](https://blog.golang.org/examples)
- [Goâ€™s Testable Examples under the hood](https://hackernoon.com/gos-testable-examples-under-the-hood-4a4db8db447f#.zdyld0low)

#### Benchmarks

#### Gotchas

All tests must start with the workd TestName  If that second workd is not Caps then the tests will not run.  

Bad:
```go
func Testsomething(t *testing.T) {
}
```

Good:
```go
func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
}

```



### Smell

- Go Lint  
```shell
go get -u github.com/golang/lint/golint
golint -set_exit_status .  
```


- The [Go Vet](https://golang.org/cmd/vet/) tool will analize your code to find code that copiles but smells bad.
